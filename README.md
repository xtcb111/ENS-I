# ENS-I
The above codes are used as follows
## 1、Simulation & diagno
Run the Simulation&diagno.cpp and use the hamster_1.txt file and beta_hum874_b.txt file to generate the simulation propagation file (State.txt) and diagnostic record (diagno.txt)
## 2、Inference
Using the hamster_1.txt , beta_hum874_b.txt, and diagno.txt, given the appropriate range of parameters and run the infer.cpp to get infection probability data (infer.txt)
## 3、DMP
Using the hamster_1.txt ,beta_hum874_b.txt, and diagno.txt, given the appropriate range of parameters and run the DMP.cpp  to get infection probability data (DMP.txt)
