# ENS-I
The above codes are used as follows
## 1、Simulation & diagno
Run the Simulation&diagno.cpp and use the hamster.txt file and beta.txt file to generate the simulation propagation file State.txt and diagnostic record diagno.txt
## 2、Inference
Using the hamster.txt , beta.txt, and diagno.txt, given the appropriate range of parameters and run the infer.cpp file to get infection probability data. infer.txt
## 3、DMP
Using the hamster.txt , beta.txt, and diagno.txt, given the appropriate range of parameters and run the DMP.cpp file to get infection probability data. DMP.txt
